# [DigiEXPploit]

## Description
Automates the process of evolving and devlolving angemon to get a free Anklymon for free EXP via loading. For more information check out this youtube video on setup. This macro is made to be used when you are hovering over your own Angemon. 

This macro has a rate of 2 Digimon/minute. I am sure it can be optimized but this is still much faster than the paid DLC EXP Outer Dungeon. You usually need 7 Digimon to get from level 1 -> 100
